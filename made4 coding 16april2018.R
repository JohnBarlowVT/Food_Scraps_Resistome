# note the introduction and reference manual can be opened from within R 
#
# "made4 is useful for Multivariate data analysis and graphical display of microarray data. Functions include between group analysis and coinertia analysis. It contains functions that require ade4 package."
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

# before the preliminaries

# recent versions of made4 and associated packages were built under R version 3.4.4, so like me you might need to upgrade from an older R version or else when you download made4 it will throw a warning message - I don't know if updating was absolutely necessary, but I did not chance it as my last R update was about 6 months old...

# I found a package to make the process of upgrading R a bit easier - the installr package - it seemed to work well and included an option to upgrade packages when it ran
# preference is to run installr in the R Gui console, not from R studio
# here is a link on updating R with installr http://bioinfo.umassmed.edu/bootstrappers/bootstrappers-courses/courses/rCourse/Additional_Resources/Updating_R.html

# you can install the installr package from RStudio
install.packages("installr")
# then close RStudio and open RGui
# in RGui open the installr library and run updateR
# library(installr)
# updateR()

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# the preliminaries

# download made4 package - made4 package uses ade4 package, scatterplot3d package, RColorBrewer and gplots

# once your R version is up to date, then on to the preliiminaries of installing made4 and associated packages - ade4 and scatterplot3d appear to install automatically when you install made4

install.packages("made4")
#install.packages("ggtree") # ggtree not available for most recent version
install.packages("ape")

## Korin suggested will need to install made4 as below, not via install.packages(), but install.packages seemed to work for me (although it loaded an older version and to get the most recent version I had to download direct from the made4 bioconductor site
#source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
#biocLite("made4")
#biocLite("BiocUpgrade")

setwd("C:/Users/jbarlow/Documents/Computational Biology/Food_Scraps/Food_Scraps_Resistome") 
getwd()

#load made4 - associated packages ade4, RColorBrewer, gplots, and scatterplot3d load automatically when you load made4
library(made4)

# also loaded other packages for graphical exploration of the data sets
library (reshape2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library (ggplot2)
library (ggthemes)
library (patchwork)

#### code from Korin - modified for graphical data exploration
#### co-inertia analysis using the made4 package
### loading ARGs file

res_mat <- read.csv("res_mat_abun2.csv")

### analysis won't run if there are instances where some of the samples have no data, i.e. the HOSP, 
### WOCA, and SWCA for ARGs all have zero abundance for ARGs, this identifies those instances to be removed later
none <- lapply(res_mat, function(x) all(x == 0))
which(none == "TRUE")

## removing them

res_mat2 <- res_mat[,-c(1,5,11,12,16,22,25)]


## need to force name column as rownames of the matrix to get the labels into the test
rownames(res_mat_all) <- res_mat$Name
rownames(res_mat2) <- res_mat$Name

head(res_mat2)
str(res_mat2)
head(res_mat_all)
str(res_mat_all)

## loading bacterial taxonomy data
# same code as above compiled for bac data

#mat <- as.data.frame(bac_mat1)
bac_mat <- read.csv("bac_mat_abun.csv")
bac_mat2 <- bac_mat[,-c(1,5,11,12,16,22,25)]
rownames(bac_mat2) <- bac_mat$Name

bac_mat2 <- b_mat2[,-1]
rownames(bac_mat2) <- b_mat$Name


### loading virulence gene dataset
vf_mat <- read.csv("vf_mat_abun.csv")
vf_mat2 <- vf_mat[,-c(1,5,11,12,16,22,25)]
rownames(vf_mat2) <- vf_mat$Name
head(vf_mat2)
vf2 <- vf_abun[,-1]
rownames(vf2) <- vf_abun$Name

#made4 has an overview function which generates a boxplot, histogram and hierachial tree of the data
overview(res_mat2)

# the histogram is compiled across all "sites" - big skew - lots of "0" values
# might want to see these data by site in a lattice
# I explored the overview function, it does not seem possible to generate separate histograms by site inside this package
# so generate in ggplot2
# the imported files are data frames
res_mat_all <- res_mat[,-c(1)]
res_mat_all[] <- lapply(res_mat_all[], as.numeric)

.<-gather(res_mat_all, key="Site", value="Abundance")
head(.)
str(.)
# note this did not generate a column with the gene names - need to append this code perhaps eventually, but really not important to see the distribution on the frequency of gene counts
# now able to do a bar plot with this

g1<- ggplot(data=., mapping=aes(x=Abundance,fill=I("tomato"), color=I("black"))) + geom_histogram()+ theme_light()

g2<- g1+facet_wrap(~Site, dir="v", nrow=2)
