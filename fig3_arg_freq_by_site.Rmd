![Figure 3: ARG frequency by Site - created using ggplot2 after structuring the data using the gather function of tidyr](AGRhisto.jpg)

visually demonstrates that some sites had no gene sequences identified above threshold counts (HOSP, SWCA, WOCA)

code for creating
```{r eval=FALSE}
library (reshape2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library (ggplot2)
library (ggthemes)
library (patchwork)
library(readr)

res_mat <- read.csv("res_mat_abun.csv")
res_mat_all <- res_mat[,-c(1)]
res_mat_all[] <- lapply(res_mat_all[], as.numeric)
rownames(res_mat_all) <- res_mat$Name

.<-gather(res_mat_all, key="Site", value="Abundance")
head(.)
str(.)
# note this did not generate a column with the gene names - need to append this code perhaps eventually, but this is really not important to see the distribution on the frequency of gene counts by site
# histogram on gene frequency by sites in lattice 

g1<- ggplot(data=., mapping=aes(x=Abundance,fill=I("tomato"), color=I("black"))) + geom_histogram()+ theme_minimal()
g2<- g1+facet_wrap(~Site, dir="v", nrow=2)
#ggsave(filename="AGRhisto.jpg", plot=g2, device=jpeg) #jpeg not working
ggsave(filename="AGRhisto.pdf", plot=g2, device=pdf, width=40, height=20, units="cm", dpi=300) #posted to project web page
