###Exploring resistome metagenomics in R using made4 package

###Background
We recently collected shotgun metagenomics data from multiple sources on a poultry farm feeding post-consumer food waste to their chickens. The farm collects food waste from various sources (hospital and school cafeterias, nursing homes, restaurants, grocery stores) and feeds them to chickens primarily raised for egg production. After the chickens feed on the food scraps the waste material enters a composting stream, and the processed compost is used for veri-culture and the final product is sold commercially. 

Our primary objective was to characterize the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes in the food scraps and waste material across the processing system. We used culture-based and culture-independent (shotgun metagenomics) methods to identify antibiotic resistant organisms and genes in the samples collected from the farm. We sampled across 13 locations within the system, including food scraps at their original source, food scraps fed to chickens, eggs from the chickens, compost material at various stages, material in various stages of vermi-culture, and final worm castings available for commercial sale. 

A secondary objective was to explore the associations between the types of microbial genes identified in the samples collected from this farm.
