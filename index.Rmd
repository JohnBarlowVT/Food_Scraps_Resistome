###Exploring resistome metagenomics with R using _made4_  package

##Background
We recently collected shotgun metagenomics data from multiple sources on a poultry farm feeding post-consumer food waste to their chickens. The farm collects food waste from various sources (hospital and school cafeterias, nursing homes, restaurants, grocery stores) and feeds the pooled food scraps to chickens. After the chickens feed on the food scraps the waste material enters a composting stream, and the processed compost is used for vermi-culture and the final product is sold commercially.

Our primary objective was to characterize the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes in the food scraps and waste material across the farm system. We used culture-based and culture-independent (shotgun metagenomics) methods to identify antibiotic resistant organisms and genes in samples collected from the farm. We sampled across 13 locations (sites) within the system (farm and sources), including food scraps at their original source, food scraps as fed to chickens, eggs from the chickens, compost material at various stages, material in various stages of vermi-culture, and final worm castings available for commercial sale. 

A secondary objective was to explore the associations between the types of microbial genes identified by shotgun metagenomics in the samples collected from this farm. 

A challenge with these data is that there are large numbers of genes (i.e. variables observed, or gene observations) compared to the number of samples (e.g. sample sites), and that we generate separate tables of observed genes from alignment queries to different reference databases. We propose that this is analogous to gene expression data (e.g. microarray data) obtained across different microarray platforms. Further the data contains many "0" observations, where a gene is not observed in a particular sample (graphically explored using the attached R code).

##Data structure

The data from the shotgun metagenomics study are 3 separate dataframes, each with 20 identical columns representing the collection sites and a variable number of rows representing the observed genes. At this time we are treating the replicates of metagenomic runs from each site separately (although we know they are not independent), thus there are 26 sites (13 sites with 2 metagenomic runs per site). There were 3 sites where we found no ARGs and these are later removed for co-inertia analysis between the data.frames.
